## About

This userstyle is based on [jasonlong/reddit-tighty-whities](https://github.com/jasonlong/reddit-tighty-whities) created by [jasonlong](https://github.com/jasonlong), which is no longer maintained. This fork fixes some minor issues and offers a dark theme variant.

2. Install the theme by clicking here for either the [light](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/losuler/reddit-bare-userstyle/master/reddit-bare-light.user.css) or [dark](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/losuler/reddit-bare-userstyle/master/reddit-bare-dark.user.css) theme (should open in Stylus).
